### KNN and Naive Bayes Classifiers

This project implements and compares two supervised classification algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes, to predict user purchasing behavior based on their age and estimated salary.

* **Dataset**: `User_Data.csv`, containing user demographics and a "Purchased" target variable.
* **Algorithms & Techniques**:
    * **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric algorithm used for classification, achieving 93% accuracy on this task.
    * **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, which achieved 90% accuracy.
    * **Model Evaluation**: Performance is measured using accuracy scores and confusion matrices for both models.
* **Technologies Used**:
    * Python
    * Pandas
    * Scikit-learn
